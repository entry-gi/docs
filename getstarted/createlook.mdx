  title="createlook_02.png"
  style={{ width:"48%" }}
/>

> ### Requirements
>
> - Keep your **eyes open**, and **mouth closed**.
> - **Avoid** **hands** in the frame.
> - Avoid too bright or dark **lighting**.
> - Ensure **no other person** is visible in the camera view.
> - Ensure your **face is centered** and directly **facing forward**.

</Warning>

After the snap, you'll be guided to perform a face scan.\
**Slowly rotate your head in a circular motion**, allowing the camera to **capture various angles** of your face thoroughly.

> Tip: the more you show various angles of your face, the more accurately your AI Self will resemble you.

### Waiting for Look Creation to Finish

- Approximately **1 hour later**, lip-sync functionality for your look will be ready for use.
