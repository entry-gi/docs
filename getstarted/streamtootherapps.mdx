In the control panel, click **Start Stream to Pickle Camera** to begin streaming. If this is your first time starting the stream, you'll need to install virtual devices and restart. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## Select Devices in External Apps

In the external app (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet) follow:

1. Select **Pickle Camera** as your camera.

## Pickle Delayed Voice for Lip-sync

This is for when you try to stream your AI Self into other apps like Zoom.

- Your **AI Self view (Pickle Camera)**  is **0.5s slower** than your real voice.
- So we made Pickle Delayed Voice for Lip-sync, which is an **audio stream** that is exactly **0.5s delayed version** of your voice input, so that matches perfectly with Pickle Camera.

In video call, select **Pickle Camera** as your camera and **Pickle Delayed Voice for Lip-sync** as your audio. Your video and audio will appear perfectly synced to other participants.
