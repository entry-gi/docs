every newly created look needs require a one-time lip-sync activation before lip-sync control can be used. This activation begins automatically when the look is created and takes about **1 hour**.

## After Activation: Start Lip-sync Control

Once activation is completed:

### Step 1: Initiating Lip-Sync

  style={{ width:"58%" }}
/>

- Click **Start Lip-Sync Control** to enable synchronization. It will take **7-8 seconds**.
- **Allow microphone permission** when prompted.

### Step 2: Enable Voice Isolation

  style={{ width:"57%" }}
/>

Enable the Voice Isolation setting to ensure clear audio input. This is one-time setup, so you don't need to enable everytime you open the app. For details, see [What is Voice Isolation](https://pickle.mintlify.app/getstarted/activatinglipsync#what-is-voice-isolation%3F) below.

### Step 3: Using Lip-sync

## What is Voice Isolation?

Voice Isolation prevents your microphone from capturing opponent's speaking audio. Effective when using built-in microphones (e.g., MacBook Pro Microphone) instead of earbuds. This setting is saved, so you don't need to enable it every time.
